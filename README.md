# Drawing Game
## Description
The "Drawing Game" project is a web application developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, with a primary focus on implementing interactive functionalities and real-time communication between two players. Inspired by the popular game Gartic, this project allows two players to challenge their drawing and guessing skills while competing in an exciting match.

Implementing the Two-Player Drawing Game involves creating a shared gaming environment where players can alternate between the roles of drawer and guesser. Using JavaScript and DOM manipulation techniques, developers create an interactive interface that allows players to freely draw on the screen and submit their guesses.

Furthermore, real-time communication between players is facilitated through technologies like WebSockets or other bidirectional communication solutions. This enables players to see real-time updates of their opponent's drawing and receive clues about the word or phrase they are trying to guess.

By developing the Two-Player Drawing Game, developers enhance their JavaScript skills, especially in areas such as event handling, game state management, and client-to-client communication. Additionally, they have the opportunity to explore user interface (UI) and user experience (UX) design concepts to create an engaging and intuitive gaming experience.
